Code:
aux.go: Faster/better random sampling of bits

key_gen.go: Switch on SHAKE128/SHAKE256 based on security level, switch on G-variant


Remove "nodes to store" parameter


Seed & Merkle: ComputeNodesToPublish should give bool tree rather than index list to avoid the O(n) contains check

Seed & Merkle: Make file for auxiliary functions for trees

Make the implementation class based (signer, verifier), this will allow us to remove all the params that use proto_params and tree_params

Domain seperator for HASH and CSPRNG calls (look paramaters - HASH_DOMAIN_SEP_CONST)

Make sure each CSPRNG call is calling the correct shakesum depending on the variant/problem type currently being run

Refactor to ensure all variables have well-defined lengths

Util:
Make tests
